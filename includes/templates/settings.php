            Thank you for using COVIDPress. This plugin allows you to show COVID-19 information to your visitors without complex adjustments.
            This is a first release, developed during the Hackaton <a href='https://eunitedvsvirus.devpost.com/' target="_blank">#EUvrsVid</a>, between April 24th and 26th. 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            We expect to release updates to this plugin that will allow you, as a site administrator, to customize how is displayed and where, among other improvements.
            In the meantime, we will appreciate any comment and ideas. Visit our development contact points at
